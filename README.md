uk-it-recruiter-domains
=======================
List of the domains of UK IT recruiters &amp; some scripts for processing it.

Why?
----
I get a torrent of email from IT recruiters.  Some of them contain 
well-targeted, intelligent specs for jobs I might actually want.  Most don't
and I am not excited at the prospect of a Â£15k starter role as an e-janitor
in Barnsley.  Having a list of domains the emails come from enables me to
maintain a sieve ruleset that automatically marks the lot read and archives
it into a 'recruiters' folder to dip into.
