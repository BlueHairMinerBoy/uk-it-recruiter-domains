uk-it-recruiter-domains
=======================

List of the domains of UK IT recruiters &amp; some scripts for processing it.

Why?
----

I get a torrent of email from IT recruiters.  Some of them contain well-targeted, intelligent specs for jobs I might actually want.  Sadly most are just spam; I do not want a Â£25k starter role as a web designer in Barnsley.  Having a list of domains the emails come from enables me to maintain a sieve ruleset that automatically marks the lot read and archives it into a 'recruiters' folder to dip into if I ever want a new job.

Result: instant productivity boost.
